_"Brain repurposed electric typewriter keyboard using matrix scanning"_ - Kendall Schmit, 2018

I don't know what the above means. I'm pretty sure that this Arduino sketch was meant to do matrix scanning on some old electric typewriter hardware and let me see the keypresses on a computer. I am not sure which typewriter or Arduino I was dealing with.
